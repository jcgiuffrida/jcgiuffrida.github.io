### Chicago Policy Review
The *Chicago Policy Review* is a student-run publication at the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy, the largest student-run policy journal in the country. Every day, it publishes a review of recent policy research, an inteview with a policymaker, or a special series. 

### Data visualization
As the first Data Visualization Editor of *CPR*, I built a team to provide our authors and editors with visualizations to accompany our articles. These ranged from simple charts to complex visualizations. We started with a pilot program, supplying visualizations for a handful of articles, and quickly built a full workflow to provide visualizations for any articles involving data.
